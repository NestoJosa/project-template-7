# project-template-v-7

TEST

Note:

- Boostrap 5 styles and scripts are loaded externally

Steps:

1) Clone this repo into a server folder e.g. Mamps htdocs

2) Remove the remote: git remote remove origin

3) Verify removed remote: 'git remote -v'

4) Run 'npm install'

5) Update the proxy in gulpfile

6) Run 'gulp dev': Success?

'npm install' fails

- Note this might be b/c of mismatch of node and gulp version. In order to fix, downgrade node to v14.
